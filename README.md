# "Dog-Breed-Identification":
This project is a web application built with Flask for predicting the breed of a dog based on an uploaded image. The app utilizes four pre-trained deep learning models: InceptionV3, Xception, NASNetLarge, and InceptionResNetV2, to provide diverse and accurate predictions. Users can upload a dog image through the web interface, and the app will determine the most likely dog breed along with confidence scores using the ensemble of these models.
